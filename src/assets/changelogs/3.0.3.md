- Changed the data exporter to use the HTTP export endpoint
	- Provides a significantly more reliable import/export workflow
	- While this means support for export customization and in-memory/indexdb is unavailable for now, we plan on addressing both these in the near future by providing a more robust export/import system within SurrealDB
- Fixed some unsupported highlighting syntax
- Fixed missing "add field" button in the access method editor
- Fixed missing editor completion icons
- Fixed multiple connections sometimes using the same id
